Population health data science (PHDS) is the art and science of transforming data into actionable knowledge to improve health. R is an open source programming environment for statistical computing and graphics. PHDS is captured by four words (describe, predict, discover, and advise) and extends epidemiology into five analytic domains: descriptive analytics for distribution of risks and outcomes; predictive analytics for early targeted prevention and response; explanatory analytics for causal inference and prevention design, and exploratory analytics for hypothesis generation of new causal pathways; and prescriptive analytics for optimizing decisions and resource allocations).
